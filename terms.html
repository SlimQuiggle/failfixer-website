        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By purchasing, downloading, or using FailFixer ("the Software"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Software.</p>

        <h2>2. License Grant</h2>
        <p>Upon purchase, you are granted a <strong>non-exclusive, non-transferable, personal license</strong> to use FailFixer on your own computers for personal or commercial use. This license is perpetual for the version you purchased (V1).</p>
        <p>You may activate/install the Software on up to <strong>5 computers</strong> that you personally own or control. You may not redistribute, resell, sublicense, or share the Software with third parties.</p>

        <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>FailFixer, including all code, design, documentation, and branding, is the intellectual property of its creator(s). Your purchase grants a usage license only — not ownership of the Software or its source code.</p>

        <h2>4. Permitted Use</h2>
        <p>You may use FailFixer to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Generate resume G-code files for your own 3D printing projects</li>
          <li>Use generated G-code files on printers you own or operate</li>
          <li>Use the Software for personal, educational, or commercial printing purposes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Prohibited Use</h2>
        <p>You may <strong>not</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software</li>
          <li>Redistribute, resell, or sublicense the Software</li>
          <li>Remove or alter any proprietary notices or labels</li>
          <li>Use the Software for any unlawful purpose</li>
          <li>Claim authorship of the Software</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>FailFixer is provided <strong>"AS IS"</strong> without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement.</p>
        <p>3D printing involves inherent risks. The Software generates G-code files based on your input. You are solely responsible for verifying that any generated G-code is safe and appropriate for your specific printer and setup before use.</p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>In no event shall the creators of FailFixer be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use or inability to use the Software</li>
          <li>Any G-code generated by the Software</li>
          <li>Damage to printers, prints, property, or persons resulting from use of generated files</li>
          <li>Data loss or corruption</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Total liability shall not exceed the amount paid for the Software.</p>

        <h2>8. User Responsibility</h2>
        <p>You acknowledge that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You are responsible for verifying generated G-code before sending it to a printer</li>
          <li>You understand the risks associated with resuming a failed print</li>
          <li>You will not hold FailFixer responsible for printer damage, failed prints, or other losses</li>
          <li>You are responsible for maintaining backups of your original G-code files</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Refunds</h2>
        <p>FailFixer is a digital product. Refund requests are handled on a case-by-case basis. If the Software does not function as described, contact us and we will work to resolve the issue or provide a refund at our discretion.</p>

        <h2>10. Updates</h2>
        <p>Your purchase includes all updates to the version you purchased (V1). Major version upgrades (e.g., V2) may be offered as separate purchases. There is no obligation to provide updates, new features, or support beyond the purchased version.</p>

        <h2>11. Termination</h2>
        <p>This license is effective until terminated. It will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any term of this agreement. Upon termination, you must destroy all copies of the Software in your possession.</p>

        <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Updated Terms will be posted on this page with a revised date. Continued use of the Software after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

        <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable law, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising from these Terms shall be resolved in the appropriate courts of the jurisdiction in which the Software creator resides.</p>

        <h2>14. Contact</h2>
