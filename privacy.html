        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>FailFixer ("the Software") is a desktop application that runs entirely on your local computer. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect (or don't collect) and how we handle your information.</p>
        <p><strong>The short version:</strong> FailFixer collects no data. It has no telemetry, no analytics, no accounts, and no network connectivity.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>FailFixer does <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or store any personal data. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No personal information:</strong> No names, emails, addresses, or identifiers are collected</li>
          <li><strong>No usage data:</strong> No analytics, telemetry, or usage tracking of any kind</li>
          <li><strong>No G-code data:</strong> Your G-code files are processed locally and never leave your computer</li>
          <li><strong>No network requests:</strong> The Software makes no internet connections</li>
          <li><strong>No cookies:</strong> The desktop application does not use cookies</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Website Data</h2>
        <p>This website (the FailFixer marketing site) is a static website. It does not use cookies, tracking pixels, or analytics services. No personal data is collected through this website.</p>
        <p>If this website is hosted on a third-party platform (e.g., Vercel, Cloudflare Pages), the hosting provider may collect standard server logs (IP addresses, request timestamps). This data is controlled by the hosting provider under their own privacy policy.</p>

        <h2>4. Purchase Data</h2>
        <p>FailFixer is sold through Gumroad (or another third-party payment processor). When you make a purchase:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your payment information is handled entirely by the payment processor</li>
          <li>We may receive your email address and name for order fulfillment purposes</li>
          <li>We do not store credit card numbers or payment details</li>
          <li>The payment processor's privacy policy governs how your payment data is handled</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All data processed by FailFixer (G-code files, settings, output files) is stored locally on your computer. We have no access to this data. You are responsible for managing and securing your own files.</p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>FailFixer itself uses no third-party services. The following third-party services are involved only in the purchase and distribution process:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gumroad:</strong> Payment processing and digital delivery — <a href="https://gumroad.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gumroad Privacy Policy</a></li>
          <li><strong>Hosting provider:</strong> Static website hosting (Vercel/Cloudflare) — see their respective privacy policies</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>FailFixer is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. If you are a parent and believe your child has provided personal information through a purchase, please contact us.</p>

        <h2>8. Data Rights</h2>
        <p>Since FailFixer collects no personal data through the Software itself, there is generally no data to access, modify, or delete. For purchase-related data held by our payment processor, you may exercise your data rights directly with them.</p>
        <p>If you have questions about any data we may hold (e.g., from email correspondence), contact us and we will respond promptly.</p>

        <h2>9. Security</h2>
        <p>FailFixer processes all data locally on your computer. There are no servers, databases, or cloud services that store your data. The security of your G-code files and generated output depends on your own computer's security.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. Continued use of the Software or website after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

        <h2>11. Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the purchase platform (Gumroad) or any contact method listed on the FailFixer website.</p>
